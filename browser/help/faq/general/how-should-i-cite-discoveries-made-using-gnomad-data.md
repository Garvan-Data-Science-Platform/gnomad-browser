question: 'How should I cite discoveries made using gnomAD data?'
---

Please [cite the gnomAD flagship paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2308-7#citeas) in papers that make use of gnomAD data, and provide a link to the browser if you build online resources that include the data set.

There is no need to include us as authors on your manuscript, unless we contributed specific advice or analysis for your work.
