question: 'Can I get access to individual-level genotype data from gnomAD?'
---

Many of the samples in gnomAD have individual-level sequencing data deposited in [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), and these can be accessed by [applying through that repository](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login). However, many other samples come from unpublished cohorts or from samples not in dbGaP. There is not currently any mechanism to systematically obtain individual-level genotype data from the database as a whole. A fully genotyped callset from the Human Genome Diversity Project and 1000 Genomes Project is available as part of gnomad v3.1.
