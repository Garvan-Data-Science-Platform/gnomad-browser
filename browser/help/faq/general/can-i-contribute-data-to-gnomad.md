question: 'Can I contribute data to gnomAD?'
---

Please [contact us](mailto:gnomad@broadinstitute.org) if you are a study investigator and are interested in contributing exome/genome sequencing data to the gnomAD resource. We are particularly interested in increasing the diversity included in gnomAD to improve the resource. However, please be aware that there are a number of challenges associated with incorporating external datasets into gnomAD. To produce the high quality, unified gnomAD dataset, we are unable to directly add externally generated VCFs to the gnomAD dataset and need to process all CRAM/BAM files in a uniform manner at the Broad Institute. This requires data reprocessing, including regulatory review, transfer of raw data to the Broad Institute, remapping of raw data, and generation of a VCF. We have limited funding for data reprocessing for including externally sequenced samples in gnomAD and therefore we prioritize the most valuable datasets for reprocessing.

Please also note that given the importance of gnomAD to the clinical genetics community to diagnose patients with monogenic disease, we do not include individuals recruited for severe pediatric disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis and autism) as well as their first-degree relatives, allowing the database to largely represent the general population.

All investigators who contribute data to gnomAD join the gnomAD Consortium. See our [Memorandum of Understanding](/mou) for more details on Consortium membership.
