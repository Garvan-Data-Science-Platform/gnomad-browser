question: "Why aren't population frequencies available by super-population?"
---

Unlike nuclear variant population frequencies which are reported per super-population (i.e. African, Asian, European), mitochondrial variant population frequencies are reported only per haplogroup in order to view independently arising alleles. While the origin of each top-level haplogroup can historically be categorized into broad super-populations, due to human migration the same haplogroup may be present in multiple populations. Additionally, mitochondrial haplogroups are only a marker of maternal ancestry, and not necessarily concordant with ancestry estimated from nuclear genome analyses.
