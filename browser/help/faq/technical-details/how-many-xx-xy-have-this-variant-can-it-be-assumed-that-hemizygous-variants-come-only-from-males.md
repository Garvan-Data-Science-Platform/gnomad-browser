question: 'How many XX/XY individuals have this variant? Can it be assumed that hemizygous variants come only from XY individuals?'
---

Sex for genomes was determined by X heterozygosity. Sex for exomes was based on both X heterozygosity and Y coverage. Information on allele frequency for males and females for each variant is provided in the population frequencies table on the browser and in the INFO fields of our VCF files (example: AC_male, AC_female, AF_female, AC_fin_male in releases prior to v3.0; AC-XY, AC-XX, AF-XX, AC-fin-XY for release v3.1 and later). If a variant is on the X chromosome, it can be assumed that hemizygous variants come from males and homozygous variants in non-PAR regions come from females.
