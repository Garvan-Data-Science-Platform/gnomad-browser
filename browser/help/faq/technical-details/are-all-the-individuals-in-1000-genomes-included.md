question: 'Are all the individuals in 1000 Genomes included?'
---

The majority of samples from the 1000 Genomes Project for which *exome sequencing* is available were included in v2. Whole genome sequencing from 3,202 subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project was included in gnomAD v3.1, though some were filtered out by our QC pipeline. A [fully genotyped callset containing individual genotypes for these data](/downloads#v3-hgdp-1kg) is available.
