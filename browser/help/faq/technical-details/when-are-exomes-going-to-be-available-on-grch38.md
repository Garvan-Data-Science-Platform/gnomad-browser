question: 'When are exomes going to be available on GRCh38?'
---

This is to come in 2021 with gnomAD v4! At this time, we have GRCh38 lifted-over versions of the gnomAD v2 datasets available on our downloads page. However, note that these are imperfect and contain a number of known issues. For example, some variants cannot be lifted-over and in some cases, multiple variants map to the same position in GRCh38.
