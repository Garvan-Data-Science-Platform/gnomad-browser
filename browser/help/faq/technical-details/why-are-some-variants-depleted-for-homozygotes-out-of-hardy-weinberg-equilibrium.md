question: 'Why are some variants depleted for homozygotes/out of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)?'
---

It has recently come to our attention that prior to v3.1 a number of genotypes with a high proportion of alternate allele reads (Allele Balance; AB >= 90%) were being called as heterozygous when they may be homozygous. This deflates the number of reported homozygotes, and is especially apparent at common variants and more so for long insertions and deletions. This will affect frequency estimates and especially the calculation of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Use caution when interpreting the frequencies of these variants. See our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/784157) for more details.

The issue is now fixed for new gVCFs generated by HaplotypeCaller moving forward. However, for v3.1, the majority of variant calls were already generated using an uncorrected version of HaplotypeCaller. We therefore made an adjustment to heterozygous genotypes with highly skewed allele balance (>0.9) at common variant sites (>0.01 AF), setting these genotypes to homozygous alternate genotypes. This change is reflected in the aggregate allele frequencies, allele numbers, and allele counts displayed on the browser as well as in the genotype data released for the gnomAD HGDP and 1000 Genomes callset.
