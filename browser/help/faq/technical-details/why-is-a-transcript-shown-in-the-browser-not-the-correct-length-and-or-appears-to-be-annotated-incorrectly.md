question: 'Why is a transcript shown in the browser not the correct length and/or appears to be annotated incorrectly?'
---

Our transcript annotations are based on GENCODE v35 for gnomAD v3.1, GENCODE v29 for gnomAD v3 and GENCODE v19 for v2. Annotations may have changed depending on the version of GENCODE used (such as changing from a non-coding to a protein-coding gene, or having a different transcript length).
