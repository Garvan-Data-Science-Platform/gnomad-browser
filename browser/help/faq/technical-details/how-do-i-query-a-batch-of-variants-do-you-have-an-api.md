question: 'How do I query a batch of variants? Do you have an API?'
---

We currently do not have a way to submit batch queries on the browser, but we are actively working on developing an API for gnomAD. If you would like to learn about GraphQL, which we will use to work with the API, an overview can be found at [https://graphql.org](https://graphql.org).You can also obtain information on all variants from the VCFs and Hail Tables available on our [downloads page](/downloads).
