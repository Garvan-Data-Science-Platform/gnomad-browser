question: 'Which variants are included in the observed counts?'
---

We included single nucleotide changes that occurred in the canonical transcript that were found at a frequency of < 0.1%, passed all filters, and at sites with a median depth >= 1. The counts represent the number of unique variants and not the allele count of these variants.
