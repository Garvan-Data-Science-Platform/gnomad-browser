question: 'How was the expected number of variants determined?'
---

We used a depth corrected probability of mutation for each gene to predict the expected variant counts. More details can be found in the [gnomAD flagship paper]("https://broad.io/gnomad_lof). Note that the expected variant counts for bases with a median depth <1 were removed from the totals.
