question: 'Why are there fewer variants in the constraint table than displayed on the gene page?'
---

We only included variants that were found in the canonical transcript of the gene. On the gene page, variants found in all transcripts are displayed. Additionally, both observed and expected variant counts were removed for sites with a median depth < 1.
