# Include filtered variants

Selection this option will include variants that did not pass our quality control process.

If filtered variants are included, the data source icons in the variant table will be distinguished with reduced opacity and a dotted border to indicate lower reliability.

Be careful when including filtered variants: some poor quality variants (and summary statistics) will be added to the table. This feature should be used with caution.
