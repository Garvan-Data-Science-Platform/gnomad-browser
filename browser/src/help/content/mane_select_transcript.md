# MANE Select transcript

MANE stands for Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI and MANE Select identifies one high-quality representative
transcript per protein-coding gene that is well-supported by experimental data and represents the biology of the gene.
More background on the MANE project can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/). Please note, the
browser represents transcript versions from Gencode v29, which may differ from more recent versions selected by the
MANE Select project. Please check the version number here (drawn from the MANE Select FTP site) and the version on the
transcript list down below in the browser to be aware of possible discrepancies.
