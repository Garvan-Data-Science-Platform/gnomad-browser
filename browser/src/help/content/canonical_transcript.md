# Ensembl canonical transcript

The canonical transcript is generally the longest transcript, though not necessarily the most biologically relevant. It is defined by Ensembl [here](https://ensembl.org/Help/Glossary).

Please note, Ensembl will soon use MANE Select, when available, as the default/primary transcript for reporting annotations.
