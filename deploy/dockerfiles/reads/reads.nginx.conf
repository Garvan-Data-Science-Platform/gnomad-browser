# Temporary demo environments typically don't have a domain or SSL certificate

# the production environment, allowing the same image/deployment to be used in

# Ingress/load balancer only accepts requests for gnomad.broadinstitute.org,
# all requests to the production environment will be redirected to HTTPS.
