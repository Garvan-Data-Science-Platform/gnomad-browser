# gnomAD Read Data

Data for the "Read Data" visualizations on the gnomAD browser's variant page.

The individual read visualizations are based on "mini-BAMs" containing data for a small window around a variant.
The code for generating the "mini-BAMs" is located in the [broadinstitute/gnomad-readviz](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gnomad-readviz) repository.

Tracks containing the reference sequence and transcripts (based on Gencode data) are also shown.
